# Introduction

Effective communication is crucial for any organization's success. With the rise of digital communication, emails have become a vital tool for exchanging information and collaborating among team members. Analyzing email communication patterns can provide valuable insights into organizational dynamics, productivity, and employee behavior. This project aims to investigate the communication patterns during work hours, focusing on email exchanges between executives, departments, and devices used. The analysis will uncover trends, sentiment, and preferences, providing actionable recommendations for enhancing communication and productivity within the organization.
